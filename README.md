- **Supply Delivery System**: Pick up and deliver supplies to hospitals
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Navigate around both static and mobile obstacles
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Customize your viewing experience
- **Simulation Controls**: Start, stop, reset, and adjust simulation speed
- **Manual Override**: Take control of the robot with keyboard inputs
- **Decision Log**: Track the robot's decision-making process
- **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback on the robot's current state

## üß† Robot AI Logic

The robot's decision-making process is governed by a sophisticated AI system that prioritizes tasks and makes optimal decisions at each step:

### Mission Objectives

1. **Supply Delivery Cycle**:
   - Navigate to the supply pickup location
   - Collect one supply (cargo capacity: 1)
   - Deliver the supply to the nearest hospital
   - Return to the supply pickup for the next delivery
   - Complete a total of 2 deliveries

2. **Return Home**:
   - After completing all deliveries, return to the starting position (0,0)

### Decision Hierarchy

The robot follows a strict decision hierarchy at each step:

1. **Unstuck Protocol**: If the robot detects it's stuck in a loop, it will execute an unstuck protocol to find a new path
   ```javascript
   if (isRobotStuck()) {
       attemptToGetUnstuck();
       return;
   }
   ```

2. **Resource Management**: Check if resources are critically low and prioritize recharging/refueling
   ```javascript
   if (handleResourceManagement()) {
       return; // Resource management took priority
   }
   ```

3. **Mission Objectives**: Based on current state, determine the next objective
   ```javascript
   if (ROBOT.deliveredSupplies && !ROBOT.returnedToStart) {
       // Return to start after completing all deliveries
       moveTowardsTarget(0, 0);
   } else if (ROBOT.hasSupplies) {
       // Deliver supplies to hospital
       const hospital = findNearestCellOfType(CELL_TYPES.HOSPITAL);
       moveTowardsTarget(hospital.x, hospital.y);
   } else {
       // Get supplies from pickup location
       const supplyPickup = findNearestCellOfType(CELL_TYPES.SUPPLY_PICKUP);
       moveTowardsTarget(supplyPickup.x, supplyPickup.y);
   }
   ```

### Pathfinding Strategy

The robot uses a combination of A* pathfinding and heuristic-based movement decisions:

1. **A* Pathfinding**: For complex routes, especially around danger zones
2. **Heuristic Movement**: For immediate decisions when full pathfinding isn't necessary
   ```javascript
   // Sort moves by how much they reduce distance to target
   filteredMoves.sort((a, b) => {
       const distA = calculateDistance(
           ROBOT.position.x + a.dx, ROBOT.position.y + a.dy,
           targetX, targetY
       );
       const distB = calculateDistance(
           ROBOT.position.x + b.dx, ROBOT.position.y + b.dy,
           targetX, targetY
       );
       return distA - distB;
   });
   ```

3. **Danger Avoidance**: Special logic to detect and avoid danger zones
   ```javascript
   if (dangerZones.length > 0) {
       // Use A* pathfinding to find a safe path around danger zones
       const path = findPath(
           currentPosition.x, currentPosition.y,
           missionTarget.x, missionTarget.y
       );
   }
   ```

4. **Anti-Loop Protection**: Tracks recent positions to avoid getting stuck in movement loops
   ```javascript
   // Add current position to recent positions list
   ROBOT.recentPositions.push({x: ROBOT.position.x, y: ROBOT.position.y});
   if (ROBOT.recentPositions.length > ROBOT.maxRecentPositions) {
       ROBOT.recentPositions.shift(); // Remove oldest position
   }
   ```

## üèôÔ∏è City Environment

The city is represented as a 12x12 grid with various cell types:

- **Streets**: Normal pathways for the robot
- **Buildings**: Permanent obstacles that block movement
- **Hospitals**: Delivery destinations for supplies
- **Fuel Stations**: Locations to refill the robot's fuel
- **Charging Stations**: Locations to recharge the robot's energy
- **Danger Zones**: Areas that drain resources rapidly
- **Supply Pickup**: Location to collect supplies for delivery
- **Schools**: Special areas to navigate around
- **Mobile Obstacles**: Dynamic obstacles that move around the city

## üîã Resource Management

The robot must carefully manage two critical resources:

### Energy
- Starting value: 100 units
- Depleted by movement (1 unit per move)
- Recharged at charging stations
- If energy reaches 0, the mission fails

### Fuel
- Starting value: 50 units
- Depleted by movement (0.5 units per move)
- Refilled at fuel stations
- If fuel reaches 0, the mission fails

The robot intelligently prioritizes resource replenishment when levels get low:
```javascript
// Check if energy is critically low
if (ROBOT.energy < 30) {
    const chargingStation = findNearestCellOfType(CELL_TYPES.CHARGING_STATION);
    if (chargingStation) {
        logDecision(`Energy critically low (${ROBOT.energy}). Moving to charging station.`);
        moveTowardsTarget(chargingStation.x, chargingStation.y);
        return true;
    }
}

// Check if fuel is critically low
if (ROBOT.fuel < 15) {
    const fuelStation = findNearestCellOfType(CELL_TYPES.FUEL_STATION);
    if (fuelStation) {
        logDecision(`Fuel critically low (${ROBOT.fuel}). Moving to fuel station.`);
        moveTowardsTarget(fuelStation.x, fuelStation.y);
        return true;
    }
}
```

## üß≠ Pathfinding Algorithm

The robot uses a sophisticated A* pathfinding algorithm to find optimal paths through the city:

1. **Initialization**: Create open and closed sets, with the start node in the open set
2. **Evaluation**: Calculate F, G, and H scores for each node
   - G = cost from start to current node
   - H = estimated cost from current to goal (Manhattan distance)
   - F = G + H (total estimated cost)
3. **Exploration**: Explore neighbors of the current node with lowest F score
4. **Path Construction**: Once the goal is reached, reconstruct the path
5. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Automatically avoid buildings, danger zones, and mobile obstacles

The algorithm includes special handling for:
- Danger zone avoidance
- Resource-efficient routing
- Dynamic obstacle prediction
